             <p>It all starts with Ashley McClure, our lead Architect. Ashley graduated from Auburn University in 2004 with dual degrees in Architecture and Interior Architecture. Ashley has worked in both large and small firms over the last 11 years, honing his skills as a designer as well as a project manager, hoping along the way to build his own space in the industry. Hence, Studio Wythe. We are a full service design firm specializing in project types that focuses on the human experience: residential, restaurant, and retail. We live, work and play in Decatur/Atlanta Georgia. We offer a tailored approach to design that responds and innovatively collaborates with the creative energy of our clients.  We focus on creating evocative spaces that enhance the human condition.</p></div>

          <h3>Why Wythe&#63;</h3>
            <p>A wythe is a single layer of brick, especially in older buildings where the entire structure was multiple layers of brick thick.  These layers were tied together with even more bricks laid perpendicular to the layers, which is the origination of most masonry traditional coursing patterns.  These interlocking and weaving layers brought stability and strength, and it’s why so many of these structures are still standing today.</p> <strong> &#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;</strong><br>
            <br> 
            <p class="blurb">Studio Wythe is a place created for dialogue, sharing of ideas, and interaction that makes the built environment more solid.  We are weavers of ideas&#44; stories&#44; and materials&#46;</p>

        <div class='about right'>
        <h3>Expertise</h3>
          <p id="topRight">We have over 11 years experience in everything from small boutique homes and retail spaces, to large corporate and educational projects with over 50,000sf. We have experience in multiple climates, industries, and budgets.</p><br>
            <p class="blurb"> Not everyone does what we do all day long&#44; which means hiring an expert will give you the most value for your budget&#46; We&#39;re happy to walk you through the process&#44; explain cost estimation processes&#44; who we need to talk to during the process&#44; and why everything takes so damn long&#46;</p> <br>
            <p>We like working with real materials. Brick, stone, wood, and steel are our No. 2 pencils: our everyday. Innovation has to be at the forefront of what we do and we have to keep a discerning eye.  Many materials that promise longevity and maintenance-free upkeep deliver only non-repairable wear and tear.  Similarly, we will push for the best installation methods to keep your materials at their best and aging properly. We’re not afraid of buildings with a little patina - it happens to the best of us. </p>
