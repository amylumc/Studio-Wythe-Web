            <h3>The General Muir</h3>
            <p>A Real-Deal New York Delicatessen in Atlanta—and We'd Like it Back, Please
Why isn’t this delicatessen in New York? It belongs in Brooklyn, or the Lower East Side. Well, maybe the Brooklyn or the LES of a half-century ago. Just to be clear, this is an authentic delicatessen, not a deli—one of those shops that slaps together honey ham on a stale roll with a bag of chips. </p>

The appealing space, with black-and-white checkered floors and subway-tiled walls, feels less like the well-worn delis of days gone by and more like the ones of the future.</p>

            <p class="editorial">Atlanta Homes and Lifestyles, General Excellence (May 2013)</p>
            <p>The design summons New York, with a dining room awash in white subway tiles and steel trusses, an industrial look that takes on the air of a brasserie when the lights go down at night. </p>

            <h3>The Cockentrice </h3>
                <p>High on one wall are glass cases where home-cured salumis are hung to age, like a cross between an Italian salumeria and a museum of natural history. Union meat-cutter pins are embedded in the locally made tabletops, and displayed at the entrance is an original scale from the Krog Street Stove Works. Who could not like this place?
Corby Kumer, “The Cockentrice”, Atlanta Magazine, May 2015
…the space honors the industrial bones of the building as well as the history of butchery.
Angela Hansberger, “First Look: The Cockentrice,” Creative Loafing, February 12, 2015
One of the full-service anchors at Krog Street Market, the Cockentrice is a place defined by the celebration of butchery and charcuterie, from glass cases near the front entrance to displays of cured meats hanging around the dining room. Sturdy wood and metal tables and chairs, upholstered banquettes, and the tidy tiles and stainless steel surrounding the open kitchen give the space the stately feeling of an updated chophouse.

             <h3>Saltyard</h3>
             <p>The space is tall, dark, and handsome. There are weathered wood beams overhead, steely gray walls, and heavy black pendant lamps hanging above the bar. The front door puts you face-to-face with the open kitchen and chef's table lined with watermelon-size jars of exotic salts, a nod to the restaurant's namesake. Further in, a smooth white slab of poured and polished concrete tops the 10-seat bar.
