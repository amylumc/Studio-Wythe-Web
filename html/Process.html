    <h1>The Process</h1>
        <p>Process
In every project, there is a story.  Sometimes it lies on top, revealed and ready.  Sometimes it takes some work to dig it out, but it’s always there.  Our clients’ stories have come from their past, their dreams, and their passions, and we look forward to learning how your story can speak through the built environment.  This is how we start: a narrative that speaks to who you are, where your passions are, and how the public will engage with your story.  We fancy ourselves storytellers with wood and stone.	

            This story plays itself out through the rest of the design phase, and even into its documentation.  Eventually, we have documented a narrative in drawing form, ready to be translated into a physical representation.  Our documents are skillfully crafted to consider all aspects of the construction and implementation of your story, and will be different for each project.  </p>

<h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
The best stories are told together.  That’s why at Studio Wythe, we’d love to meet your chef, your graphic designer, your best friend, or your tattoo artist.  We’re open to new ways of thinking that comes from working with people across fields and disciplines, and sometimes the best idea comes from somewhere else.  We’re okay with that - and we’ll be excited to implement a vision no matter where it originates.  </p>
